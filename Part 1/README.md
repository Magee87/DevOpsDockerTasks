# PART 1:
i skipped last task: EXERCISE 1.16: CLOUD DEPLOYMENT, because i didnt found any free cloud services (i have used all of them, and i didnt wanna left it hanging.)

I also used windows computer, so i did have to do some tricks to make some tasks working correctly.

Otherwise it was pretty nice course. thank you.
